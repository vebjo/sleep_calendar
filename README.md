# sleep_calendar
This is a simple python script that plots fitbit sleep data into a visual calendar. Also shows average time of falling asleep.

2. Download or clone the repository
3. Add your csv-file with fitbit data to the folder 
4. Add the file name to line 19
5. Run the script using "python sleep_calendar.py"
